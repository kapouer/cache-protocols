Json Web Token Scopes protocol
==============================

Using a shared private key between the application and the proxy,
it is possible to define scopes-based cache keys.


Install
-------

```
npm install upcache
```


What are scopes ?
-----------------

Scopes are a common way to define fine-grain accesses to an API, see
for example:
https://auth0.com/blog/2014/12/02/using-json-web-tokens-as-api-keys/


Usage
-----

```
var scope = require('upcache/scope')({
	publicKey: <rsa public key>,
	privateKey: <rsa private key>,
	algorithm: 'RS256', // optional
	maxAge: age in seconds, must be an integer,
	userProperty: "user" // optional, populates req[userProperty] if set
});

// ensures key handshape and req[userProperty]
app.use(scope.init);

app.post("/login", function(req, res, next) {
	dblogin(req.body.login, req.body.password).then(function(user) {
		user.scopes = {
			subscriber: {
				read: true
			},
			editor: {
				write: true
			},
			[`user-${user.id}`]: true
		};
		scope.login(res, user); // this sets a cookie, scope.sign(user) returns signed bearer
	});
});

app.get("/logout", function(req, res, next) {
	scope.logout(res);
	res.sendStatus(204);
});

app.get('/api/user', scope.restrict("&user-*", "admin"), myMidleware);

```

Restrictions
------------

A restriction is an alphanumeric string that defines two different things:
- how the application authorizes the current request
- how the proxy builds a key for a given request

Multiple restrictions can be given as arguments,
in which case the bearer must match at least one of them to get access.

A restriction can be made mandatory by prefixing it with a `&`; this is only
useful when multiple restrictions are given since at least one of them must be
matched.

A restriction can contain a wildcard `*` which match zero or more chars.
In this case, all scopes matching the restriction will be used to build the
resource cache key.
This is useful when multiple users see different versions of the same url;
it avoids tracking lots of restrictions variants for a given url.

A restriction can contain a parameter replacement `:name` which will be
replaced if any parameter with that name is defined in `req.params`.
The actual restriction will be the one after replacement.


Restrictions and actions
------------------------

A restriction can also be defined for each type of action, where actions are
mapped like this:

> read: head, get
> write: add/del/save
> add: post
> del: delete
> save: put, patch

```
app.all('/api/books', scope.restrict(
	"admin", {
		read: "bookReader",
		write: "bookWriter"
	}, {
		del: "cleaner"
	}
), appMw);
```

In this situation, it is often needed to restrict a write action but not a read
action.

A natural way of doing this would be to not restrict all actions that are not
defined - but it would be very error prone since it would give access in case
one forgets to mention some action.

To avoid such mistakes, a special meaning is given to restrictions when they
are booleans:
* true means do not restrict access, and since it always match it effectively
empties the restriction list
* false means never grant access - not setting anything has the same effect


```
app.all('/api/items', scope.restrict({
	read: true,
	write: "itemWriter"
}), appMw);
```
Here all clients will get read access to the same version of the resource,
and only clients with the right scope will have write access.

Note that a set of restrictions like
`{ read: true, write: "one" }, { read: "readtwo", write: "two"}` will never
match the "readtwo" restriction. Instead, to grant access to public and
to a "readtwo" scope, it is simpler to declare a "public" permission and
automatically log all users with it.


Methods
-------

req, res are the parameters received by express middleware;

user is an object expected to have a `scopes` array of strings.

- scope.init(req, res, next)  
  middleware setting up handshake headers and req[userProperty]
- scope.sign(req, user, options)  
  sign user with hostname as issuer, returns a jwt
- scope.login(res, user, options)  
  calls sign and sets cookie
- scope.logout(res)  
  unset cookie
- scope.restrict(perms...)  
  returns a middleware that sends 401/403 or let through  
  sets response headers for proxy
- scope.test(req, perms...)  
  checks this request, returns false if access is not granted, or else the list
  of granted permissions  
  sets response headers for proxy


Bearer scopes
-------------

Actions are read, add, save, del; and write is a shorthand for add+save+del.

User scopes is an object with permissions as keys and an object mapping actions
to booleans as value.
That object can be replaced by boolean true as a shorthand for
`{ read: true, write: true }`.


Cache protocol
--------------

The caching proxy must be able to build request keys out of a request url
and scopes read from a JWT.

The application is responsible (in its HTTP response headers) to provide two
pieces of information to the proxy:

- X-Upcache-Scope  
  a list of restrictions as defined above

- X-Upcache-Grant (optional optimization)  
  the actual list of granted bearer scopes

- X-Upcache-Bearer (optional, defaults to cookie_bearer)  
  this can be `http_bearer`, or `cookie_bearer`, following nginx variable names.

Examples where application grants access to bearers:
- with scope A or scope B (but not none): `A,B`
- with optional scope A and mandatory scope B: `A,+B`
- with scope A and scope B: `+A,+B`
- with scope /root/* or scope /other/*: `/root/*,/other/*`
- any scope: `*` (all scopes will match and be used to build the key)

The cache is not responsible for granting or denying access: it must just knows
how to build a cache key given a bearer and those rules.

A client without any bearer is always granted the empty scope "", which will
always match the wildcard scope "*".


Public key handshake
--------------------

If the proxy doesn't have the public RSA key for jwt payload verification of the
current domain, it adds this request header as soon as possible
- X-Upcache-Key-Handshake: 1

The application is responsible for sending back in the response this header:
- X-Upcache-Key-Handshake: MFwwDQY...

The application can send that header in a response at any time, to update the
proxy copy of the public key after a change (the js scope lib deals with that).
