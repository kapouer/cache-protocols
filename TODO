## Debug mode
- control logs from nodejs' DEBUG env var
- nginx conf do not prune application headers
- and computed cache keys are added in X-Cache-Key

## More modular
ability to setup whole cache by adding a single line
probably achievable by creating a nginx module.

## rsa key renewal transition
- existing valid jwt must still be verifiable
- scope.js must be able to generate and cache rsa key every x seconds

## more explicit API for scopes
Prepending "&" before permission is an implementation detail - the Node.js api should be explicit.

## per upstream Host configuration for cache key
For a given upstream, a "host" variable can be set by the upstream by sending
a response header X-Cache-Host. That value replaces the default ngx.var.host used
to compute request/response keys.

## define exactly which chars are allowed in tags/scopes

Typically "=" is forbidden in a scope to avoid confusion with a tag.

## test "true" restriction (access), test empty restriction list (deny)

## ability to manipulate tag values with precision ?
- redesign tag protocol so versions are passed to upstream
- redesign tag api so one can add a callback to tag() to change the tag value
However it does not seem to be that useful for now.

## should all scopes be tested against a given restriction, or just stop at the first one ?
