## Debug mode
- control logs from nodejs' DEBUG env var
- nginx conf do not prune application headers
- and computed cache keys are added in X-Cache-Key

## More modular
- ability to setup whole cache by adding a single line - probably achievable by creating a nginx module

## rsa key renewal transition
- existing valid jwt must still be verifiable
- scope.js must be able to generate and cache rsa key every x seconds

## more explicit API for scopes
Prepending "&" before permission is an implementation detail - the Node.js api should be explicit.

## per upstream Host configuration for cache key
For a given upstream, a "host" variable can be set by the upstream by sending
a response header X-Cache-Host. That value replaces the default ngx.var.host used
to compute request/response keys.

## define exactly which chars are allowed in tags/scopes

Typically "=" is forbidden in a scope to avoid confusion with a tag.
